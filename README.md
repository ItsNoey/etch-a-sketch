# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a game where you can draw on a grid pad. You can change the color of your pen and the size of the grid. This project is sadly not responsive. 

I love sending my project out to my friends and family for them to play with, but I will need to learn the touch events for mobile and tablet first. I will come back and try to make it look as nice and functional as possible on smaller screens.
